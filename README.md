# üèôÔ∏è SahaGovern ‚Äì Your City, Your Voice

**SahaGovern** is a civic engagement and community platform that bridges the gap between **citizens** and **local authorities**.  
It enables residents to **report local issues** (potholes, garbage, streetlights, etc.) with **photos, videos, voice notes, and location**.  
Reports appear on a **live map** and **community feed**, where people can **upvote, comment, and track progress**.  

On the other side, officials get a **smart dashboard** to manage, assign, and track issue resolution in **real-time**, making governance **transparent and collaborative**.
